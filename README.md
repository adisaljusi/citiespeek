# Cities Peek
Cities Peek is a application that lets you view the temperature of location with latitude and longitude

## Info
As a school project I had to combine multiple APIs into one application. The idea is to select a location on a map and then display information about the weather and the location. It uses:
- **Frontend:** React + Typescript with MaterialUI
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot REST

## Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Java SpringBoot
- Postgres
- Docker

## APIs
- Unsplash
- MapBox 
- here Destination Weather API
- Selfmade API to store certain values in a database

## Start the application
### Database

Easiest way to get an database is to use a docker container for it.

Run this command:

```docker run --rm -it --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=1234 -p 5432:5432 postgres:13-alpine```

Note that you'd have to change the password if you like to run it for production.

### Frontend

#### Prerequisites 
- NPM
- yarn

##### Install packages
yarn install in the **citiespeek-fe** folder

##### Run the application

```./gradlew bootRun``` for the backend in the **citiespeek-api** folder.

You need three environment variables to be able to start the frontend application.
- REACT_APP_MAPBOX_KEY
- REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY
- REACT_APP_HERE_APY_KEY

Export environment variables. (Just Google this. I ain't gonna put links for something as easy as this. There's also a full Microsoft documentation for that on Powershell if you don't use bash)

If everything is fine, just run `yarn run start` ðŸš€ (without the rocket)

Docker compose from my side isn't as easy just creating one file and done. For production, I don't think it's the best suitable tool and if you would use an container orchestration system like K8S, then you'd have to translate your file. Also, you don't get the availability to use replicas, deployment and services. You'd have to use Docker Swarm and I'm not the biggest fan of it. Also, since I'm using the Azure cloud and deploy my images to Web App services (equivalent to Elastic Beanstalk or Container in AWS), there are certain issues with authentication in multi container Web App.
